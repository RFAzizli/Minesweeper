# Minesweeper
I think everybody heard of Minesweeper.

Basically, I recreated a "stupid" version of it using my bare hands.

To launch the game all you need is to run the Minesweeper.java

Hope you like it.

Just in case, the game is played on the console(cmd or any other IDE console).

P.S.
If you see any bugs, I will apreciate if you let me know. ðŸ™‚
